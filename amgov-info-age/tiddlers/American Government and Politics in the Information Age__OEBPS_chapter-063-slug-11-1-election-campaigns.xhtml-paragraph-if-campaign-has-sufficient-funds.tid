If the campaign has sufficient funds, retail politics involves microtargeting, using computers and mathematical models to identify peopleâ€™s vote preferences on the bases of the magazines they read, credit card purchases, and the cars they own (Wayne, 2008). This information is used to woo undecided voters and ensure that supporters are registered and cast their ballot. Microtargeting has become more common and efficient in the information age.
