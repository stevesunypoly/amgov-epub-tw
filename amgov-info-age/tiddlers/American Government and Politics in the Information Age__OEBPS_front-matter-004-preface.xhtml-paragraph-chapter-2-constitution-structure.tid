Chapter 2 “The Constitution and the Structure of Government Power” covers the foundations and structures of authority established by the US Constitution in 1789. We explain the origin, contents, development, and contemporary importance of the Constitution, noting that while American society has changed greatly in the last two centuries, the political system established by the Constitution still underlies and determines much of American government and politics. Next, in Chapter 3 “Federalism”, we describe American federalism and its complex interweaving of national, state, and local governments. Chapter 4 “Civil Liberties” and Chapter 5 “Civil Rights” cover the conflicts and disputes, debates, and decisions over the constitutional provisions establishing Americans’ liberties and the right to be free of discrimination. Throughout this first part of the book, we show that the US communication system is intimately linked to, and has often buttressed, these foundations of American government and politics.
