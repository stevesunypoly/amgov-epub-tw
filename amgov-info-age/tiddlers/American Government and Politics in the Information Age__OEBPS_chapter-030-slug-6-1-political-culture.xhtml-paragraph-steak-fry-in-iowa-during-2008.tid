A steak fry in Iowa during the 2008 Democratic presidential primary sparked a debate over candidate Barack Obamaâ€™s patriotism. Obama, standing with opponents Bill Richardson and Hillary Clinton, failed to place his hand over his heart during the playing of the national anthem. In the background is Ruth Harkin, wife of Senator Tom Harkin, who hosted the event.
