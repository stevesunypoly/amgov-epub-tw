Lengthy sentences and the fact that over three-fourths of those put in state or federal prison each year commit nonviolent crimes raise an Eighth Amendment question: does the punishment fit the crime? (Donziger ed., 1996) In 2003 the Supreme Court decided that “three strikes” was not so “grossly disproportionate” as to violate restrictions on “cruel and unusual punishment” (Ewing v. California, 2003; Lockyer v. Andrade, 2003; Solem v. Helm, 1983).
