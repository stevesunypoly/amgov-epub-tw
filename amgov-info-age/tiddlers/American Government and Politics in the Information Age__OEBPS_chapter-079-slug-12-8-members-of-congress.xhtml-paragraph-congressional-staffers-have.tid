Congressional staffers have specialized responsibilities. Some staffers have administrative responsibilities, such as running the office and handling the memberâ€™s schedule. Others are responsible for assisting members with policy matters. Personal staffers work in conjunction with committee staffers to research and prepare legislation. They write speeches and position papers. Some act as brokers for members, negotiating support for bills and dealing with lobbyists. Staff influence over the legislative process can be significant, as staffers become experts on policies and take the lead on issues behind the scenes (Hammond, 1996).
