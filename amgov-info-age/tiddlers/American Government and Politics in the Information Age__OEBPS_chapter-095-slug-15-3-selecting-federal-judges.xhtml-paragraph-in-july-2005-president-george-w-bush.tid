In July 2005, President George W. Bush made the first Supreme Court nomination in eleven years. He chose John G. Roberts Jr., a federal appeals court judge on the DC Circuit, to replace the moderate Republican Sandra Day Oâ€™Connor, who was retiring. Roberts was then nominated to be chief justice after the death of incumbent William H. Rehnquist.
