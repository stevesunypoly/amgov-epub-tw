State governors and big-city mayors, especially when they have few formal powers or when they face a state legislature or city council filled with opponents, can parlay favorable media attention into political power (Beyle &amp; Muchmore, 1983; Rosenthal, 1990; Kaniss, 1991). At best, a governor (as one wrote in the 1960s) “sets the agenda for public debate; frames the issues; decides the timing; and can blanket the state with good ideas by using access to the mass media” (Sanford, 1967).
