Issues, subjects, and public-policy positions on matters of concern are central to campaigns. Candidates take positions on issues that are designed to increase their chances of election. Issues raised during campaigns are often based on votersâ€™ concerns that are identified by polls. The media can make issues a prominent part of the election agenda, which can work for or against a candidate.
