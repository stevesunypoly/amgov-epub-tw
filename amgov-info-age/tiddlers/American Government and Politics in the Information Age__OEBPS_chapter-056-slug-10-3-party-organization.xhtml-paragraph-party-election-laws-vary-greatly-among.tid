Party and election laws vary greatly among states. In Maryland, voters must register and declare their party identification twenty-nine days before a primary election in order to participate. In Massachusetts, independents can register with a party to vote in that partyâ€™s primary on Election Day. In Wisconsin, party preference is part of the secret ballot.
