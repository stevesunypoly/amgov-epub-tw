The chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff plans and coordinates the deployment of American forces, the unified commands conduct these operations, and the military services train and equip the necessary forces. Since the 1980s, a dominant issue within the Defense Department has been improving the operational efficiency of the armed forces (Cohen, 1996; Mahnken &amp; FitzSimonds, 2003). The concern for operational efficiency is joined by a concern for cost. Almost half of the Defense Departmentâ€™s annual budget goes to salaries and a quarter to operating and maintaining military forces.
