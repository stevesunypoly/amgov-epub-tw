All three news magazines lamented that the Constitution was threatened by unscrupulous, self-interested politicians intruding into the realm of dispassionate principle. To quote Newsweek, “The endless election has not been a grand contest of famous legal gladiators contesting broad constitutional principles…[but] a local fight, a highly personal shoving match driven by old grudges and vendettas” (Thomas &amp; Isikoff, 2000). Yet it was the complex electoral and federal system devised in the Constitution itself that caused much of the crisis.
