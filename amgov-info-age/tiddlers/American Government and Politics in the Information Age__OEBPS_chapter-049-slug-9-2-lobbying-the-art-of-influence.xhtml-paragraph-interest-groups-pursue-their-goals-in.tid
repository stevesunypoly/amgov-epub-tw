Interest groups pursue their goals in court (Gonen, 2003). They may challenge a policy, appeal adverse decisions by other branches of government, and file suits against public officials to require them to take or refrain from taking some action. The US Chamber of Commerceâ€™s National Chamber Litigation Center represents the interests of business before the courts.
