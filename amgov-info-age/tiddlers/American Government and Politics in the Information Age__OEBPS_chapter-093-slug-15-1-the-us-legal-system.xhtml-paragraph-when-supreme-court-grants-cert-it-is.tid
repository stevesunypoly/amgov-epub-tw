When the Supreme Court grants cert, it is usually because four or more of the justices believe the case represents an important issue, such as an unresolved constitutional or statutory question on which they are interested in ruling. Sometimes disputes between different courts need to be resolved, or Congress and lower courts need the Courtâ€™s guidance on the Constitution. However, it is not unknown for justices to avoid granting cert to important cases because they do not want to rule on them (Kloppenberg, 2001).
