The most visible member of a White House publicity apparatus—and the key person for reporters—is the presidential press secretary (Klein, 2008). The press secretary is “responsible for creating and disseminating the official record of the president’s statements, announcements, reactions, and explanations” (Kumar, 2007). The press secretary has three constituencies with different expectations of him: “the president, White House staff, reporters and their news organizations” (Kumar, 2007).
