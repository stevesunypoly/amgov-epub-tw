Members tailor the job to their personalities, interests, objectives, and constituent needs (Fenno, 2003). They engage in activities that better their chances for reelection. This strategy works, as the reelection rate for incumbents is over 90 percent (Jacobson, 2002). They promote themselves and reach out to constituents by participating in events and public forums in their home districts. More recently, outreach has come to include using social media to connect with the public. Members of Congress take positions on issues that will be received favorably. They claim success for legislative activity that helps the districtâ€”and voters believe them (Abramowitz, 1975; Fiorina, 1977; Mayhew, 1974). Successful members excel at constituent service, helping people in the district deal with problems and negotiate the government bureaucracy.
