State and local governments are essential parts of federalism because the federal government routinely needs them to execute national policy. State and local governments adjust the policies as best they can to meet their political preferences and their residentsâ€™ needs. Policies and the funds expended on them thus vary dramatically from one state to the next, even in national programs such as unemployment benefits (Dye, 1990; Peterson, 1995).
