Fulfilling his campaign pledge, repeated in his inaugural address, to close the gap in achievement between poor and minority children and children attending primarily white schools in the suburbs and to improve school performance, President George W. Bush obtained passage of significant amendments to the ESEA in the No Child Left Behind Act of 2002. He signed the legislation into law in an elaborate ceremony accompanied by his bipartisan congressional allies.
