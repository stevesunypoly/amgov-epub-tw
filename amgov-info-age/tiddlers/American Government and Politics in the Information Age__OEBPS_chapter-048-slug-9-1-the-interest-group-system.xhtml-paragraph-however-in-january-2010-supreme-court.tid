However, in January 2010 the Supreme Court ruled that the government cannot ban political spending by corporations in candidate elections. The court majority justified the decision on the grounds of the First Amendmentâ€™s free speech clause. The dissenters argued that allowing unlimited spending by corporations on political advertising would corrupt democracy.
