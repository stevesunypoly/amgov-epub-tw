Bargaining and compromise sometimes ensue in an effort to create a majority coalition (Murphy, 1964; Maltzman, Spriggs II, &amp; Wahlbeck, 2000; Brenner &amp; Whitmeyer, 2009). A study of justices’ conference notes concludes that the Court’s decisions come from “an intricate and shifting composite of law, politics, policy, principle, efficiency, expedience, pragmatism, dogmatism, reason, passion, detachment, individual personality, group psychology, institutional forces, and external pressures” (Dickson, 2001). To this list, we would add the desire for approval from social groups with which they identify or associate and from the legal community of law professors and law students (Baum, 2006).
