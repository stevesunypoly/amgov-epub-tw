The newspaper pointed out that states have widely different standards for measuring students’ progress—there is no agreement on how much students need to know to be considered proficient. Many states have low proficiency standards. Students ace these state tests only to fail more rigorous federal exams (Dillon, 2005). States with high standards could be penalized by having many failing schools, while states with low standards and poor performance would be left alone (Fessenden, 2003; Winerip, 2003).
