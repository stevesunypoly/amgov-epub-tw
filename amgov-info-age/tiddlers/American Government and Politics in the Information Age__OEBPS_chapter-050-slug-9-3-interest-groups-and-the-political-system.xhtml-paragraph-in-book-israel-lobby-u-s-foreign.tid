In the book The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy, John J. Mearsheimer and Stephen M. Walt argue that the activities of interest groups, notably the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, are one reason why, since World War II, the United States has provided more direct economic and military support to Israel than any other ally and pursues a policy of preserving and enhancing Israelâ€™s security (Mearsheimer &amp; Walt, 2007; Mearsheimer &amp; Walt, 2009; Lieberman, 2009). This raises the question of why interest groups succeed or fail to achieve their policy objectives.
