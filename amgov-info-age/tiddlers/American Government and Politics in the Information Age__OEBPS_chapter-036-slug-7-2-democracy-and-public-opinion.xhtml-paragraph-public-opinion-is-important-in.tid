Public opinion is important in a democracy, as it can guide policy decisions. There is disagreement about the extent to which political leaders should take the publicâ€™s views into account compared with the advice of experts. Many people do not have a good understanding about issues and related policies. Deliberative polling is an attempt to give people the opportunity to become more informed about issues and to contemplate policy options.
