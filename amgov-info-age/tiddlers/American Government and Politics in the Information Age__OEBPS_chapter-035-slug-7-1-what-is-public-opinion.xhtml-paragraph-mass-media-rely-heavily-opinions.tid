The mass media rely heavily on the opinions of government elites, especially when covering foreign policy and domestic issues, such as the economy and employment. The breadth of news coverage about foreign affairs is constrained to reflect the range of viewpoints expressed by officials such as members of Congress who are debating the issues. The voices of average Americans are much less prominent in news coverage (Bennett, Lawrence, &amp; Livingston, 2007). As political scientist V. O. Key stated, “The voice of the people is but an echo” (Key Jr., 1961).
