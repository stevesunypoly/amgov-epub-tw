Nonetheless, press conferences have risks for presidents. Since reportersâ€™ questions have become more challenging over time, presidents shy away from press conferences more and more (Clayman &amp; Heritage, 2002). Increasingly, they rely on joint press conferences, most often with foreign leaders. Such press conferences add questioners from another press corps, limit the number of questions to a handful, and reduce the amount of time for the president to answer questions.
