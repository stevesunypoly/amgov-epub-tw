An enduring image of the US government is the president signing into law a piece of legislation just passed by Congress. The president is surrounded by the members of Congress responsible for and citizens benefiting from the lawâ€™s passage. The ceremony requires many pens because after each stroke the president gives one to someone associated with the legislation.
