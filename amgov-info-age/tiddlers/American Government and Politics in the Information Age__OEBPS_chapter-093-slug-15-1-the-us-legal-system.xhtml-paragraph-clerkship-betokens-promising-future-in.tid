A clerkship betokens a promising future in the legal profession. Because the clerks’ work is confidential and rarely revealed, the extent of justices’ reliance on their clerks is uncertain. One former clerk writing about the Court charged that the justices granted “great and excessive power to immature, ideologically driven clerks, who in turn use that power to manipulate their bosses” (Lazarus, 1998). Yet, most justices are so self-confident and versed in the law that it is hard to imagine them being led to make decisions against their will.
