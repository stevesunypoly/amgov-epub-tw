Agencies are part of the executive branch. Presidents select heads of agencies and make numerous other political appointees to direct and control them. But political appointees have short careers in their offices; they average just over two years (Aberbach &amp; Rockman, 2000). Civil servantsâ€™ long careers in government in a single agency can easily outlast any political appointee who spars with them (Aberbach &amp; Rockman, 2000).
