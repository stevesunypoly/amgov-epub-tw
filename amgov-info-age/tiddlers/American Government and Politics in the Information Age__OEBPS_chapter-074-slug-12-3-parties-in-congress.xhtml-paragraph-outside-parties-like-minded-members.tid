Outside of parties, like-minded members can form factions or specialized coalitions to promote a particular agenda. Some factions are long-standing groups with pronounced ideological leanings. They form coalitions to support or oppose legislation (Smith, Roberts, &amp; Wielen, 2003). Some factions are based on membersâ€™ identification with a group. These include the Congressional Black Caucus and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus.
