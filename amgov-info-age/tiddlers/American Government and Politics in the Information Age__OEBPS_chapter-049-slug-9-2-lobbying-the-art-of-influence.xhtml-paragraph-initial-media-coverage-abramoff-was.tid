Initial media coverage of Abramoff was favorable. On July 3, 2000, the Wall Street Journal published a front-page story describing his “money, methods and results” as “exceptional” (VandeHei, 2000). On April 2002 the New York Times published a similar front-page story, with quotes such as “‘I call Jack Abramoff, and I get results’” and, from the lobbyist himself, “‘All of my political work…is driven by philosophical interests, not by a desire to gain wealth’” (Rosenbaum, 2002). Both stories included criticisms of the lobbyist but depicted the man and his power and accomplishments positively overall.
