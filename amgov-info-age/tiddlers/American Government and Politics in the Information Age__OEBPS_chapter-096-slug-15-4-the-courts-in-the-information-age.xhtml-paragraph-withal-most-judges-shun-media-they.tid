Withal, most judges shun the media. They rarely hold press conferences or discuss current cases (Davis, 1994; Drechsel, 1983). Toni House, who served as the Supreme Court’s public information officer for many years, described her job as “peculiar in Washington because this office doesn’t spin, it doesn’t flap, it doesn’t interpret…When an opinion comes down, we put it in the hands of a reporter” (Slotnick &amp; Segal, 1998). Nowadays, the court does frequently release audio of the oral arguments.
