Native Americansâ€™ civil rights issues today center on tribal autonomy and self-government on Indian reservations. Thus some of the provisions of the Bill of Rights, such as the separation of church and state, do not apply to tribes (Talton v. Mayes, 1896). Reservations may also legally discriminate in favor of hiring Native Americans.
