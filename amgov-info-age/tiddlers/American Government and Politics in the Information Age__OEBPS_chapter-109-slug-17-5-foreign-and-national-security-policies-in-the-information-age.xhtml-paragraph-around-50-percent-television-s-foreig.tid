Around 50 percent of television’s foreign coverage portrays violence (Hachten &amp; Scotton, 2007). Man-made and natural disasters—with their villains, victims, and heroes—are also news (Rotbeg &amp; Weiss, 1996). These often occur where news bureaus are not located. For example, the main news in late December 2004 and on into 2005 concerned the horrifying death of at least 150,000 people and the destruction at the shorelines of several Asian countries caused by the tsunami waves that resulted from underwater earthquakes in the Indian Ocean.
