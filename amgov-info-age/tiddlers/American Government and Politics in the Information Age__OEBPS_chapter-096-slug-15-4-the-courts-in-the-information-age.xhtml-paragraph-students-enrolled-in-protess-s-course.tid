Students enrolled in Protess’s course sometimes complain about the heavy workload, but most devote the time and energy willingly. “Once you get that involved in a case, you make it your life’s work. You know you could have an innocent life at stake, and if you don’t save it, nobody will,” states one graduate (Moberg, 2000). Some of Protess’s students go on to cover the criminal court beat or become lawyers working for the rights of the accused.
