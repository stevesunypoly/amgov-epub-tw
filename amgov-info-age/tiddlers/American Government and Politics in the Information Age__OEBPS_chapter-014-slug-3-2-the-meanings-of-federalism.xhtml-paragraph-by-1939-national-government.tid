By 1939, national government expenditures equaled state and local expenditures combined (Anton, 1988). FDR explained his programs to nationwide audiences in “fireside chats” on the relatively young medium of radio. His policies were highly popular, and he was reelected by a landslide in 1936. As we describe in Chapter 15 “The Courts”, the Supreme Court, after rejecting several New Deal measures, eventually upheld national authority over such once-forbidden terrain as labor-management relations, minimum wages, and subsidies to farmers (National Labor Relations Board v. Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel, 1937; United States v. Darby, 1941; Wickard v. Filburn, 1942). The Court thereby sealed the fate of dual federalism.
