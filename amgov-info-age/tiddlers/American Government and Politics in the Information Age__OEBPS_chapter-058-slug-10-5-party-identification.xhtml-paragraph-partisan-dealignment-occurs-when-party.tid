Partisan dealignment occurs when party loyalty declines and voters base their decisions on short-term, election-specific factors, such as the leadership qualities of a candidate (Burnham, 1970). The inclination of people to identify as independents rather than as partisans is evidence that a dealignment is occurring (Beck, 2003). A partisan dealignment may be occurring today, as more people are identifying as independents and more voters select their candidates on the basis of personal traits, such as honesty. Mass media can contribute to partisan realignment by focusing attention on candidatesâ€™ personalities and scandals, which are short-term factors that can influence vote choice.
