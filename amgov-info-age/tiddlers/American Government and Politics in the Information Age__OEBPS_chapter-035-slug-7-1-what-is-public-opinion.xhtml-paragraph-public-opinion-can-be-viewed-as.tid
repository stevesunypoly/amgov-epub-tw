Public opinion can be viewed as the collection of individual opinions, where all opinions deserve equal treatment regardless of whether the individuals expressing them are knowledgeable about an issue or not. Thus, public opinion is the aggregation of preferences of people from all segments of society. The use of public opinion polls to gauge what people are thinking underlies this view (Glynn et al., 1999). By asking questions of a sample of people who are representative of the US population, pollsters contend they can assess the American publicâ€™s mood (Herbst, 1993). People who favor this perspective on public opinion believe that government officials should take into account both majority and minority views when making policy.
