The first comprehensive lobbying regulation was enacted in 1946. The Legislative Reorganization Act required lobbyists to register their affiliation and record their finances (US Government Printing Office, 2011). Later, the 1995 Lobbying Disclosure Act required lobbying firms and lobbyists to register with Congress and file reports twice per year listing their compensation, clients, lobbying expenses, and issues they are following for each of their clients (US House of Representatives, 2011). Only trivial gifts from lobbyists to legislators are allowed (Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995, 1995).
