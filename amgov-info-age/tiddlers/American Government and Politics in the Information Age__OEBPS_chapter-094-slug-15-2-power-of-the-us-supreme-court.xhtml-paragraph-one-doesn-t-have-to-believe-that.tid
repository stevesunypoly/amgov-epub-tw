One doesnâ€™t have to believe that justices are politicians in black robes to understand that some of their decisions are influenced, if not determined, by their political views (Peretti, 1999). Judges appointed by a Democratic president are more liberal than those appointed by a Republican president on labor and economic regulation, civil rights and liberties, and criminal justice (Carp, Manning, &amp; Stidham, 2001). Republican and Democratic federal appeals court judges decide differently on contentious issues such as abortion, racial integration and racial preferences, church-state relations, environmental protection, and gay rights.
