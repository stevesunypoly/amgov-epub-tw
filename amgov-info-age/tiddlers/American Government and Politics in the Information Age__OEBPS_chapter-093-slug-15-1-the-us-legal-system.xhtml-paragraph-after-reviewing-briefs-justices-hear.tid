After reviewing the briefs, the justices hear oral arguments, usually limited to an hour split equally between the sides. The justices often interrupt the attorneys with questions, probe arguments made in the briefs, and raise new issues; they may indicate their thinking about the case and possible decision. The arguments can be used by the justices to reach the legal and policy decisions that they prefer (Johnson, 2004)—unless, that is, one side’s lawyer makes a more convincing argument than the other (Johnson, Wahlbeck, &amp; Spriggs II, 2006). Oral arguments are the only public part of the Supreme Court’s work.
