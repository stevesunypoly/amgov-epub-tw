Political participation is action that influences the distribution of social goods and values (Rosenstone &amp; Hansen, 1993). People can vote for representatives, who make policies that will determine how much they have to pay in taxes and who will benefit from social programs. They can take part in organizations that work to directly influence policies made by government officials. They can communicate their interests, preferences, and needs to government by engaging in public debate (Verba, Schlozman, &amp; Brady, 1995). Such political activities can support government officials, institutions, and policies, or aim to change them.
