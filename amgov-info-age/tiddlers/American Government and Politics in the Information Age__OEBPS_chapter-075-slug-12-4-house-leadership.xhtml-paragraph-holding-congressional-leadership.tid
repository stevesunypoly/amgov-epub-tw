Holding a congressional leadership position is challenging, especially as most members think of themselves as leaders rather than followers. Revolts can occur when members feel leaders are wielding too much power or promoting personal agendas at the expense of institutional goals. At times, a leaderâ€™s style or personality may rub members the wrong way and contribute to their being ousted from office (Cooper &amp; Brady, 1981).
