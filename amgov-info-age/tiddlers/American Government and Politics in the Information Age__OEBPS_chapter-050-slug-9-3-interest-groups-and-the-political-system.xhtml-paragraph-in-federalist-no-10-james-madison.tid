In Federalist No. 10, James Madison warns of the dangers of factions: “[A] number of citizens, whether amounting to a majority or minority of the whole, who are united and actuated by some common impulse of passion, or of interest, adverse to the rights of other citizens, or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the community” (Madison, 1961; Library of Congress, 2011). Madison believed that factions were inevitable, because their causes were “sown in the nature of man” (Madison, 1965).
