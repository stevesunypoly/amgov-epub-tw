The Supreme Court exercised its new power gradually. The Court followed selective incorporation: for the Bill of Rights to extend to the states, the justices had to find that the state law violated a principle of liberty and justice that is fundamental to the inalienable rights of a citizen. Table 4.1 “The Supreme Court’s Extension of the Bill of Rights to the States” shows the years when many protections of the Bill of Rights were applied by the Supreme Court to the states; some have never been extended at all.
