The second reason federalism often works is because national, state, and local governments specialize in different policy domains (Peterson, 1995). The main focus of local and state government policy is economic development, broadly defined to include all policies that attract or keep businesses and enhance property values. States have traditionally taken the lead in highways, welfare, health, natural resources, and prisons (Anton, 1988). Local governments dominate in education, fire protection, sewerage, sanitation, airports, and parking.
