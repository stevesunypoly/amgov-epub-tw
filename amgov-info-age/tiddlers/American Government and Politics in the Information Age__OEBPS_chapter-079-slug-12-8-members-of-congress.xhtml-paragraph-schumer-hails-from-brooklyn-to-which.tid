Schumer hails from Brooklyn, to which he attributes his affinity for speaking his mind. “That’s one of the benefits of being a Brooklynite. You’re a straight shooter with people, and people are back with you. And sometimes you offend people” (Leibovich, 2005). While his Brooklynese may offend some, it generates headlines and plays well in New York, where he easily wins reelection campaigns.
