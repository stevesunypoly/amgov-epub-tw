Wedge issues are issues that cut across party lines. A candidate can increase her vote by splitting off some of the people who usually support the other party and its candidates (Hillygus &amp; Shields, 2008). Republicans have employed affirmative action as a wedge issue in order to siphon off from the Democratâ€™s base working-class white men who oppose it. Democrats have used abortion rights to appeal to some conservative Republican women.
