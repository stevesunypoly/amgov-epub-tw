Each chapter presents the most common media depictions of its subject. In some chapters, a few depictions dominate: most news coverage portrays the US Supreme Court and its decisions as above politics (except when the president has nominated a new member); and the entertainment media depict the judicial system unrealistically. In other chapters, depictions are split. For example, in Chapter 4 “Civil Liberties”, we see that journalists’ diligent defense of the civil liberties that are central to their job does not carry through to their stories about crime or war.
