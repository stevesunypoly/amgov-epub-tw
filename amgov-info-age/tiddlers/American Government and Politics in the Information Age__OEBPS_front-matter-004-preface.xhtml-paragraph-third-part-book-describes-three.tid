The third part of the book describes the three intermediaries—interest groups (Chapter 9 “Interest Groups”), political parties (Chapter 10 “Political Parties”), and campaigns and elections (Chapter 11 “Campaigns and Elections”)—that connect the people to government and also link officials within government. Participants in these intermediaries often rely heavily on the media for much of their information, while also seeking to avoid media coverage of their less appealing activities.
