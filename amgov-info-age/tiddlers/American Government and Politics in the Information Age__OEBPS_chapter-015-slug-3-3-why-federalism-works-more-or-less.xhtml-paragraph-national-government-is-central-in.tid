The national government is central in policies to serve low-income and other needy persons. In these redistributive policies, those paying for a service in taxes are not usually those receiving the service (Peterson, Rave, &amp; Wong, 1986). These programs rarely get positive coverage in the local news, which often shows them as “something-for-nothing” benefits that undeserving individuals receive, not as ways to address national problems (Peterson, Rabe, &amp; Wong, 1986).
