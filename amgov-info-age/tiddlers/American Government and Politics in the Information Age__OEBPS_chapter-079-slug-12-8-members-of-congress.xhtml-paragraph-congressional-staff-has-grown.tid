Congressional staff has grown substantially since the 1970s as the number of policy issues and bills considered by Congress increased. Today, House personal staffs consist of an average of fourteen people. Senate staffs range in size from thirteen to seventy-one and average about thirty-four people (Davidson &amp; Oleszek, 2002). As a result of staff expansion, each member has become the head of an enterpriseâ€”an organization of subordinates who form their own community that reflects the personality and strengths of the member (Salisbury &amp; Shepsle, 1981).
