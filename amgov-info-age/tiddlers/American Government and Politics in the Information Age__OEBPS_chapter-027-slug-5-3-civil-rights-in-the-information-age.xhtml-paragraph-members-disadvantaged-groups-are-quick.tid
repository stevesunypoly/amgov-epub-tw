Members of disadvantaged groups are quick to see the media acting as agents of discrimination, reinforcing derogatory stereotypes (Larson, 2005). They therefore monitor media content and apply pressure on both news and entertainment media to influence how their members are portrayed (Montgomery, 1989). They threaten boycotts of media companies and advertisers. One of the first endeavors of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) was to protest against D. W. Griffithâ€™s feature film Birth of a Nation (1913), which portrayed African Americans after the Civil War as stupid and venal and celebrated the Ku Klux Klan. Even if the controversy does not end in a withdrawal of the offensive material, it sensitizes media executives to the risks of potentially inflammatory programming.
