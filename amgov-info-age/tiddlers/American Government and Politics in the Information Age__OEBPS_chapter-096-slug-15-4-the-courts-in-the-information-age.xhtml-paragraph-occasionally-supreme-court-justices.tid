Occasionally, Supreme Court justices give speeches about broad constitutional issues, talk off the record with a journalist, or rarely, engage in an on-the-record interview (Brennan Jr., 2010). They may write a book setting forth their judicial philosophies and go on television to publicize it (Scalia, 1998; Breyer, 2005). Justice Stephen Breyer appeared on Larry King Live to promote his latest book. He was circumspect, carefully avoiding discussing cases in any detail or revealing the Courtâ€™s deliberations (Breyer, 2010).
