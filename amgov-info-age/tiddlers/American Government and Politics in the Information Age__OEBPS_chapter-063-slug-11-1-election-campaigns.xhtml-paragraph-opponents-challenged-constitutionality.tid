Opponents challenged the constitutionality of these laws in the federal courts, arguing that they restrict political expression (Smith, 2001; Samples, 2006). In the 1976 case of Buckley v. Valeo, the Supreme Court upheld the limits on contributions and the reporting requirement but overturned all limits on campaign spending except for candidates who accept public funding for presidential election campaigns (Buckley v. Valeo, 1976). The Supreme Court argued that campaign spending was the equivalent of free speech, so it should not be constrained.
