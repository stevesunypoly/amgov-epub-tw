Members of the public can follow congressional action live on television. After much debate, televised coverage of floor proceedings via the Cable Satellite Public Affairs Network (C-SPAN) was established in the House in 1979 and in the Senate in 1986. C-SPAN transmits gavel-to-gavel coverage of floor action. It covers committee hearings and broadcasts educational panels and events.
