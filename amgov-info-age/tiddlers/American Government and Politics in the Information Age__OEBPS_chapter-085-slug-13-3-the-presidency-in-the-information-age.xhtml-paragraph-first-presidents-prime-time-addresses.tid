First, presidentsâ€™ prime-time addresses, even when carried by all networks, reach a smaller portion of the audience than they did in years past (Foote, 1990; Baum &amp; Kernell, 1999). The profit-minded media discourage presidents from taking too often to the airwaves. When presidents request air time, broadcast television networks can conclude the subject is not adequately newsworthy and turn them down.
