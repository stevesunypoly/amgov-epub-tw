Meanwhile, internationalism reigns. Internationalism means involvement in events beyond one’s borders to accomplish and protect the national interest (Baldwin, 1993; Nye Jr., 2002). It has dominated American foreign policy since 1955, a decade after World War II ended. Internationalists favor democratization, free trade, and a policy of global military activism designed to maintain America’s dominant position in world affairs. But specific policies have varied depending on the administration in power.
