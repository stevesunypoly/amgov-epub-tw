Quite often a policy appears only to affect specific corporations or industries and therefore does not receive much media or public attention (Smith, 2000). The Walt Disney Companyâ€™s copyright on Mickey Mouse was due to expire in 2003 and those on Pluto, Goofy, and Donald Duck would expire soon after. In 2000, after lobbying and well-placed campaign contributions by Disney, Congress extended all copyrights for twenty more years (Surowiecki, 2011).
