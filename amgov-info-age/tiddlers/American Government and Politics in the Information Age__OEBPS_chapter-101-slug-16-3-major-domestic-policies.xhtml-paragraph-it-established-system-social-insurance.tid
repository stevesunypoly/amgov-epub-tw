It established a system of social insurance in which taxes on payrolls were used to provide benefits to the elderly. Social Security was soon expanded to cover benefits for “survivors,” including widows, dependent children, and orphans. In 1956, disabled Americans were added to the list of beneficiaries, thus formally creating the Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance (OASDI) system (Berkowitz, 2003). In 1972, benefit levels were tied to the consumer price index—benefit levels go up when the consumer price index does.
