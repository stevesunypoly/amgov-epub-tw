Television and radio advertisements are essential elements of election campaigns (Diamond &amp; Bates, 1992; Jamieson, 1996). Ads capitalize on peopleâ€™s beliefs and values. They are often designed to arouse emotions, such as anxiety and fear, hope and enthusiasm (Brader, 2006). They attract attention with dramatic visuals, sounds, and slogans. They sometimes exaggerate, even distort, information.
