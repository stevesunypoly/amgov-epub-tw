Agencies also obtain political support by shifting policies when new political participants challenge their standard approach (Mazmanian &amp; Nienaber, 1979; Brehm &amp; Gates, 1997). For example, in the 1970s the Army Corps of Engineers moved away from a rigid prodevelopment stance when environmental groups arose and lobbied for a law requiring the Corps to draft environmental impact statements.
