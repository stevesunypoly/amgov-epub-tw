Deliberations took place in secret, as delegates did not want the press and the public to know the details of what they were considering (Note 2.16 “Comparing Content”). Newspapers hardly mentioned the convention at all, and when they did, it was in vague references praising the high caliber of the delegates (Alexander, 1990).
