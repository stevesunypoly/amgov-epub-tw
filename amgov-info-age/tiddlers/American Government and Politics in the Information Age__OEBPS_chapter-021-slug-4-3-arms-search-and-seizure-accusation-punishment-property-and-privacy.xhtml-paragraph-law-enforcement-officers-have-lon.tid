Law enforcement officers have long bridled at the exclusionary rule and claim that “technicalities” allow guilty suspects to be set free. The Supreme Court has permitted the use in trial of seized evidence that would have been “inevitably discovered” even without an unconstitutional search—such as that “in plain view”—or which police officers acquired under a search warrant that they did not know was improperly issued (Weeks v. United States, 1914; Mapp v. Ohio, 1961; Nix v. Williams, 1984; United States v. Leon, 1984; Massacusetts v. Sheppard, 1984).
