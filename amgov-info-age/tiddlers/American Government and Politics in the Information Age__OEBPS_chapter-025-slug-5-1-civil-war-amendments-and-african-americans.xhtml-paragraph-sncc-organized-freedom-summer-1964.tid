The SNCC organized the Freedom Summer of 1964, a campaign to register voters in Mississippi, the state with the largest percentage of blacks and the lowest rate of black voter registration. Massive resistance from whites resulted in violence, culminating in the murder of three civil rights workersâ€”one black and two white. Murders of white civil rights activists generated more public outrage and received more news coverage than murders of black participants.
