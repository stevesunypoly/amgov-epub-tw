type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Each chapter opens with an anecdote that ties media to the particular institution, process, or policy area under study. For example, Chapter 4 “Civil Liberties” starts by showing how the television reality show Cops depicts the police as working effectively to stop crime but downplays the civil liberties of individuals, including the rights of the accused.
