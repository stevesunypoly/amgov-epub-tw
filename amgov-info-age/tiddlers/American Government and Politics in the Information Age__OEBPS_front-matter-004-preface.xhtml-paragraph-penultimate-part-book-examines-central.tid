The penultimate part of the book examines the central institutions of the federal government—Congress (Chapter 12 “Congress”), the presidency (Chapter 13 “The Presidency”), the federal bureaucracy (Chapter 14 “The Bureaucracy”), and the federal judicial system (Chapter 15 “The Courts”)—taking them in order of their appearance in the Constitution. People in these institutions spend considerable time, energy, and resources in dealing with the media, although the ways in which they do so vary depending on their responsibilities and powers and on the media’s highly uneven interest in their actions.
