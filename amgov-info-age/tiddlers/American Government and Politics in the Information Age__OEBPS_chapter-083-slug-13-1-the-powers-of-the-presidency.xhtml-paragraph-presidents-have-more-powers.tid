Presidents have more powers and responsibilities in foreign and defense policy than in domestic affairs. They are the commanders in chief of the armed forces; they decide how (and increasingly when) to wage war. Presidents have the power to make treaties to be approved by the Senate; the president is Americaâ€™s chief diplomat. As head of state, the president speaks for the nation to other world leaders and receives ambassadors.
