title: American Government and Politics in the Information Age//OEBPS/front-matter-004-preface.xhtml-paragraph-in-each-chapter-we-compare-reality
toc-type: paragraph
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

In each chapter, we compare the reality of American government and politics with the mediaâ€™s most common depictions (acknowledging that there are differences between and among the media and in their political content). We show that the depictions range from accurate and revealing to inaccurate and misleading. We distinguish the telling accounts and insights from partial truths, false impressions, and distortions.
