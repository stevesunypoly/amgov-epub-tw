The “Enduring Image” box captures a chapter’s subject visually. Instantly recognizable, these images are part of our media-induced collective memory of government and politics. Each box explains the original meaning of the image, why it was so important, and its contemporary relevance. For example, the enduring image in Chapter 8 “Participation, Voting, and Social Movements” is of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. making his “I Have a Dream” speech from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial to the vast crowd participating in the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom in August 1963, at the height of the civil rights movement.
