Elections are crucial in a representative democracy like the United States. They enable people to choose their leaders and thereby influence public policy. They endow elected officials with legitimacy. There are two main types of elections: primary and general elections. Candidates from the same political party contest for the partyâ€™s nomination in primary elections. Candidates from different parties run in the general election, which decides who will take office.
