Bills are the most typical form of legislation. They can originate in either the House or Senate, with the exception of bills for raising revenue, which must be initiated in the House (Sullivan, 2008). The same bill must pass through all the formal procedural hurdles in the House and Senate before it can be sent to the president to be signed into law.
