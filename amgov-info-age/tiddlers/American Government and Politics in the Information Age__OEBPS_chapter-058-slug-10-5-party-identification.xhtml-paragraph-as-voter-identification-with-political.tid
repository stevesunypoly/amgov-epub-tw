As voter identification with political parties has declined, so has dedication to the two-party system. According to a national survey, citizens have more trust in product brands, such as Nike, Levis, Honda, and Clorox, than in the Democrats and Republicans (Lauro, 2000). Since the 1980s, Americans have become skeptical about the two major partiesâ€™ ability to represent the public interest and to handle major issues facing the country, such as crime, the environment, and saving Social Security. At the same time, support for third parties, like the Tea Party, has increased over the last decade (Owen &amp; Dennis). Still, the two-party system continues to dominate the political process as a viable multiparty alternative has not emerged.
