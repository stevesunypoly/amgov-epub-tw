The gay rights movementâ€™s first political efforts were for laws to bar discrimination by sexual orientation in employment, the first of which were enacted in 1971 (Button, Rienzo, &amp; Wald, 1997). President Bill Clinton issued an executive order in 1998 banning discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in federal government employment outside the military. By 2003, nondiscrimination laws had been enacted in 40 percent of American cities and towns.
