The concept guiding American foreign policy in this global struggle with the Soviet Union and its allies was containment (Gaddis, 1993). It held that the United States did not need to engage in a war to defeat the Soviet Union. Instead it could adopt a policy of constant vigilance and the creation of alliances in which American power would be used to contain and counter Soviet aggressive moves.
