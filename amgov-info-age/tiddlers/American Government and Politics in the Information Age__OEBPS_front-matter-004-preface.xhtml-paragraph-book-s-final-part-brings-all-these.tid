The book’s final part brings all of these strands together to analyze policymaking and the contents of public policies. Chapter 16 “Policymaking and Domestic Policies” describes the policymaking process and looks at social and economic policies. Chapter 17 “Foreign and National Security Policies” is concerned with foreign and defense policies. We show where the media have, and have not, been influential in shaping policy outcomes in the United States.
