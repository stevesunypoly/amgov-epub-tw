In 1980, the EEOC defined sexual harassment as unwelcome sexual advances or sexual conduct, verbal or physical, that interferes with a personâ€™s performance or creates a hostile working environment. Such discrimination on the basis of sex is barred in the workplace by the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and in colleges and universities that receive federal funds by Title IX. In a series of decisions, the Supreme Court has ruled that employers are responsible for maintaining a harassment-free workplace. Some of the elements of a sexually hostile environment are lewd remarks and uninvited and offensive touching (Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson, 1986; Harris v. Forklift Systemsn, Inc., 1993; Burlington Industries, Inc., v. Ellerth, 1998; Farragher v. City of Boca Raton, 1998; Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc., 1998).
