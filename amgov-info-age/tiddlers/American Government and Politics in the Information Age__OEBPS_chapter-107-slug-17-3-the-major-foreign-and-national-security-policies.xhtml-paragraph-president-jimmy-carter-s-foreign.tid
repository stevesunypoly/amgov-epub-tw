President Jimmy Carter’s foreign policy emphasis on human rights pushed US–Soviet competition into the background (Johansen, 1980; Liang-Fenton, 2004). He criticized the human rights abuses of leaders who had loyally stood by the United States in its containment of the Soviet Union. One of those criticized was the shah of Iran. Put into power through a coup engineered by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in 1953, the shah had been one of America’s staunchest Cold War allies. But by the 1970s, he had become increasingly isolated within his own country (Kinzer, 2002).
