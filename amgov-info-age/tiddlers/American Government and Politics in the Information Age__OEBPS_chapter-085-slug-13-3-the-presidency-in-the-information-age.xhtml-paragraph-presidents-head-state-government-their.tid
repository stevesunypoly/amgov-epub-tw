Presidents head the state, government, and their political party. So almost anything they do or that happens to them is newsworthy (Farnsworth &amp; Lichter, 2006). They are the sole political figures whose activities are followed around the clock. Presidents fit news values perfectly. The ongoing saga of a familiar hero engaged in myriad controversies and conflicts, international and domestic, is far simpler to explain and present than complex scenarios of coalition-building in Congress.
