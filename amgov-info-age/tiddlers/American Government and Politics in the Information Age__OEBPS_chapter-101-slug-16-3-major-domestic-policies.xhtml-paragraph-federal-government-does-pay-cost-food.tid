The federal government does pay the cost of food stamps. Nearly one in seven Americans receives them, with an average benefit of $500 a month for a family of four. Removing the stigma of welfare from the stamps, the government changed the programâ€™s name to Supplemental Nutrition Assistance. Making it even more acceptable, it is supported by farmers and grocery stores (DeParle &amp; Gebeloff, 2011; DeParle &amp; Gebeloff, 2010).
