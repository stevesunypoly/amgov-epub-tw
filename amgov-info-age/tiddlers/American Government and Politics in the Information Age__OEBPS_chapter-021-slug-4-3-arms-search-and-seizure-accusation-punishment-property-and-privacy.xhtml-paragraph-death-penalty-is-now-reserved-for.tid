The death penalty is now reserved for the most serious of crimes: murder and treason. In 1972, the Supreme Court threw out all state laws imposing the death penalty as a violation of due process being arbitrarily applied from one case to the next. In 1976, the Court allowed states to impose capital punishment as long as it is decided on by a jury following a strict process, weighing mitigating and aggravating circumstances to decide if death is the most appropriate punishment (Furman v. Georgia, 1972; Gregg v. Georgia, 1976; Woodson v. North Carolina, 1976). After 1976, thirty-eight states reinstated the death penalty, which by then was endorsed by a strong majority of the public.
