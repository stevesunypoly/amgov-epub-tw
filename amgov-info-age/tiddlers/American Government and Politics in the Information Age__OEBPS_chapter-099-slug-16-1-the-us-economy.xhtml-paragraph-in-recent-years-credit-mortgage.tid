In recent years, credit, mortgage, and regulatory policies contributed to an economic crisis in the United States. Responding to the economic crisis, the government has become more involved in managing the economy than ever before. Monetary policy is mainly determined by the Federal Reserve Board. Fiscal policy is mainly made by the presidentâ€™s economic advisors and Congress. Deciding the federal budget is a complicated and often contentious process involving the presidency and Congress.
