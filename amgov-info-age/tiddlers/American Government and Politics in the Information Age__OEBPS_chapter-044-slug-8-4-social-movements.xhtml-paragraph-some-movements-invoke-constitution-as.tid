Some movements invoke the Constitution as a justification for violent action against the government. The militia movement believes it must preserve the Constitutionâ€™s Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. Members conduct regular drills in military dress during which they fire high-powered weapons. The movement uses an elaborate system of websites and independent radio stations to present their position and communicate with one another.
