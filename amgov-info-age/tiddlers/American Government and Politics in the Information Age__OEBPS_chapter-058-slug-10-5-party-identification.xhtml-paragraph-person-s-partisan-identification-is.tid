A personâ€™s partisan identification is defined as a long-term attachment to a particular party (Campbell et al., 1960). Americans are not required to formally join party organizations as is the case in other democracies. Instead people self-identify as Republicans, Democrats, or members of minor parties. They also can declare themselves independent and not aligned with any political party (Green, Palmquist, &amp; Schickler, 2002).
