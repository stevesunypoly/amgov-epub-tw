In nominating Supreme Court justices, presidents seek to satisfy their political, policy, and personal goals (Comiskey, 2004; Eisgruber, 2007; Davis, 2005). They do not always succeed; justices sometimes change their views over time or may surprise the president from the start. “Biggest damfool mistake I ever made” said President Dwight D. Eisenhower about his appointment of Chief Justice Earl Warren, who led the Supreme Court’s liberal decisions on civil rights and criminal procedure.
