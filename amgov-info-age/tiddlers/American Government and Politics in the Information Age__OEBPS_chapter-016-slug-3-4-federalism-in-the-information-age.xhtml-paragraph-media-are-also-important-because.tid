The media are also important because officials are news consumers in their own right. State legislators value news exposure to communicate to other legislators, the governor, and interest groups and to set the policy agenda (Cooper, 2002). Thus legislative staffers in Illinois conclude that news coverage is a better indicator of public opinion than polls (Herbst, 1998). The news may more heavily and quickly influence officials’ views of problems and policy issues than the public’s.
