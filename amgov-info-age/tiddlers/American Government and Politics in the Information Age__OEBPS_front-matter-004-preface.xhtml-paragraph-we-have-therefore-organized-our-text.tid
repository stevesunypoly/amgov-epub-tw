title: American Government and Politics in the Information Age//OEBPS/front-matter-004-preface.xhtml-paragraph-we-have-therefore-organized-our-text
toc-type: paragraph
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

We have therefore organized our text to connect studentsâ€™ media-saturated daily lives to the world of politics and government. We want students to learn how the media interact with and depict the American political system; to recognize the similarities and differences between these media depictions and the real world of government and politics; and to understand the consequences these interactions and depictions can have for the public, politics, government, and public policies. We want students to learn how the media, including new media, can help them intervene productively in politics and get things done.
