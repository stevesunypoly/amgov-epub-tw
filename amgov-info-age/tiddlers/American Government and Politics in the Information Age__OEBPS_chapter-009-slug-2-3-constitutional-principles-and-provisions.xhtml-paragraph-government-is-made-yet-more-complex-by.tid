Government is made yet more complex by splitting the legislature into two separate and distinct chambersâ€”the House of Representatives and the Senate. Such bicameralism was common in state legislatures. One chamber was supposed to provide a close link to the people, the other to add wisdom (Wood, 1969). The Constitution makes the two chambers of Congress roughly equal in power, embedding checks and balances inside the legislative branch itself.
