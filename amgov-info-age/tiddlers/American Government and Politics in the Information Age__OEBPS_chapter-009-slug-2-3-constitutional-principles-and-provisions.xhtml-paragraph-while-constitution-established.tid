While the Constitution established a national government that did not rely on the support of the states, it limited the federal government’s powers by listing (“enumerating”) them. This practice of federalism (as we explain in detail in Chapter 3 “Federalism”) means that some policy areas are exclusive to the federal government, some are exclusive to the states, and others are shared between the two levels.
